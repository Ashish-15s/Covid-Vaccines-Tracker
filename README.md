[Covidvaccinetrack.com](https://covidvaccinetrack.com/) tracks the number of covid vaccine administered around the world in real time.


I made this Website to challenge myself, starting as a joke and ending up with tens of thousands of views.
I decided to make it open source, since in my opinion it is the right thing to do for its maintenance and future updates.

ANYONE is welcome here, I will accept any kind of contribution, whether you are a novice developer or with experience.
